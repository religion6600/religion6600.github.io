## K-Means

We applied KMeans clustering to a set of respondents using a range of non-religious socio-political and demographic features, including views on gender and sexuality, political ideology, education, income, attitudes toward science and government, and more. The goal was to determine whether individuals naturally group into distinct sociocultural profiles — and to assess how those profiles correspond (if at all) with religious tradition (RELTRAD).

### Optimal # of CLusters
Optimal`k` with elbow method is `k=6`. 

```{python}
X = df[features].dropna()  # Drop missing values
df_clean = df.loc[X.index]  # Preserve indices

# One-hot encode relevant categorical features
categorical_cols = ["MARITAL", "BIRTHDECADE", "RACECMB", "AFROHISP", "E2"]
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)


# Elbow Method to choose k
wcss = []
for i in range(2, 10):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X_scaled)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.plot(range(2, 10), wcss, marker="o")
plt.title("Elbow Method for Optimal k")
plt.xlabel("Number of clusters")
plt.ylabel("WCSS")
plt.show()
```


Silhouette Score demonstrates that optimal `k=2`, but there are more than two religions so this may be limiting - we won't be able to map religions directly but we can possibly see traditionalist religions vs progressive. 

### `K = 2`
```{python}
silhouette_scores = []
K_range = range(2, 10)

for k in K_range:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
    score = silhouette_score(X_scaled, labels)
    silhouette_scores.append(score)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(K_range, silhouette_scores, marker='o')
plt.title('Silhouette Score for different k')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters (k)')
plt.ylabel('Silhouette Score')
plt.xticks(K_range)
plt.show()
```

```{python}
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)
df_clean['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

```

```{python}
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
df_clean['pca1'] = X_pca[:, 0]
df_clean['pca2'] = X_pca[:, 1]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df_clean, x='pca1', y='pca2', hue='cluster', palette='Set2')
plt.title("KMeans Clustering with k=2 (PCA-reduced)")
plt.show()

```

```{python}
pd.crosstab(df_clean['cluster'], df_clean['RELTRAD'])
```

**Cluster profiles by feature (Standardized Average)**
```{python}
cluster_profiles = df_clean.groupby('cluster')[features].mean().T
cluster_profiles.columns = [f'Cluster {i}' for i in cluster_profiles.columns]
cluster_profiles.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(16, 6), colormap='Set2')
plt.title("Cluster Feature Averages (k=2)")
plt.ylabel("Mean value (standardized scale)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


**Cluster 0: Religiously Committed & Socially Conservative**

- **Higher religiosity overall**: Greater belief in God, prayer frequency, belief in heaven/hell/soul, and spiritual practices.
- **Higher scores on religious engagement**: Includes membership, religious experiences (`SPIRPER`, `RELPER`), and institutional religion variables like `ATTNDPERRLS`, `CHATTEND`, and `RELINST_*`.
- **Stronger traditional values**: More conservative responses on family, moral values (`QB2D`), and government size (`GOVSIZE1`).
- **Higher activity in spiritual life**: Notable scores on ritual participation (`PRAC_A`, `PRAC_B`, `SPIRACT_*`, `RTRT`).
- **Slightly older, more racially homogeneous** (e.g., lower `AFROHISP`, `RACECMB`) and more stable (e.g., `YEARLOCREC`, `MOVED`).
- **Likely to represent a culturally conservative, institutionally religious profile**.

**Cluster 1: Spiritual/Exploratory & Less Traditional**

- **Less committed to institutional religion**: Lower average on formal practices and beliefs (e.g., prayer, `GOD`, `HELL`, `MEMB`).
- **More individualistic or exploratory spiritual profile**: Still some belief in spiritual realms but weaker scores on structured practices.
- **More supportive of progressive norms**: Slightly higher openness (`OPENIDEN`), environmental concern (`SCIMPACT`), and diversity tolerance (`DIVRACPOP`).
- **Younger or more mobile**: Slightly lower stability markers like `YEARLOCREC` and `MOVED`.
- **More religiously disaffiliated**: Possibly includes unaffiliated, non-religious, or "spiritual but not religious" individuals.
- **Slightly more racially/ethnically diverse**, higher score on `AFROHISP`, `RACECMB`.


***RELTRAD Distribution per Cluster**
```{python}
reltrad_labels = {
    1100: "Evangelical Protestant",
    1200: "Mainline Protestant",
    1300: "Historically Black Protestant",
    10000: "Catholic",
    20000: "Mormon",
    30000: "Orthodox Christian",
    40001: "Jehovah's Witness",
    40002: "Other Christian",
    50000: "Jewish",
    60000: "Muslim",
    70000: "Buddhist",
    80000: "Hindu",
    90001: "Other World Religions",
    90002: "Other Faiths",
    100000: "Religiously Unaffiliated",
    900000: "Don't know/refused"
}


df_clean['RELTRAD_label'] = df_clean['RELTRAD'].map(reltrad_labels)
ct = pd.crosstab(df_clean['cluster'], df_clean['RELTRAD_label'], normalize='index')

ct.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(14, 7), colormap='tab20')
plt.title("RELTRAD Distribution by Cluster (k=2)")
plt.xlabel("Cluster")
plt.ylabel("Proportion")
plt.legend(title="Religious Tradition", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Conclusions: 

- **Cluster 0** is dominated by the **Religiously Unaffiliated** — over half of the group identifies this way.  
  - This aligns with a **spiritual but less institutionally religious** profile.
  - It also includes a moderate share of **Mainline Protestants** and **Catholics**, reflecting a more progressive or moderate religious expression.

- **Cluster 1** is **more religiously committed overall**.  
  - It’s heavily made up of **Evangelical Protestants**, **Catholics**, and **Historically Black Protestants**.
  - These groups are more closely tied to **institutional religious identity and traditional social values**.

- While all major traditions (e.g., Protestant, Catholic) span both clusters, the **subgroup differences matter**:  
  - **Evangelicals and Black Protestants** are much more prominent in Cluster 1.  
  - **Mainline Protestants** are more present in Cluster 0, suggesting a more **moderate or progressive religious identity**.

- So, while religion correlates with worldview, it's not the tradition label alone — it's the **type of affiliation and how it's practiced** that drives clustering.  
  - This reveals **intra-religious diversity**: people in the same tradition don’t always share the same values or sociopolitical orientation.

- **Key Insight**: The strong presence of the unaffiliated in Cluster 0 — paired with ideological diversity within religious groups — highlights the divide between **formal religiosity** and **personal spirituality or cultural religion**.


***CURREL Distribution per Cluster**
```{python}
# Map CURREL codes to readable labels
currel_labels = {
    1000: "Protestant",
    10000: "Catholic",
    20000: "Mormon",
    30000: "Orthodox Christian",
    40001: "Jehovah's Witness",

    50000: "Jewish",
    60000: "Muslim",
    70000: "Buddhist",
    80000: "Hindu",
    90001: "Other world religions",
    90002: "Other faiths",
    100000: "Religiously unaffiliated",
    900000: "Refused/uninterpretable",
}

# Apply label mapping
df_clean["CURREL_label"] = df_clean["CURREL"].map(currel_labels)

# Optional: exclude ambiguous categories
excluded_currel = [
    "Refused/uninterpretable",
    "Other Christian",

    "Other faiths",
]
df_clean_currel = df_clean[~df_clean["CURREL_label"].isin(excluded_currel)]

# Create normalized crosstab
ct_currel = pd.crosstab(
    df_clean_currel["cluster"], df_clean_currel["CURREL_label"], normalize="index"
)

# Plot

plt.title("CURREL Distribution by Cluster (k=2)")

plt.ylabel("Proportion")
plt.legend(title="Current Religion", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc="upper left")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```


#### Conclusions:

- **Cluster 0** is **dominated by the Religiously Unaffiliated**, who make up the majority of this group.  
  - This tracks with the earlier finding that Cluster 0 reflects a **less institutionally religious, more spiritual or secular** population.
  - The remaining respondents include **Catholics** and a small mix of minority traditions (e.g., Buddhist, Jewish), suggesting a more religiously diverse but less traditionally religious cluster overall.

- **Cluster 1** is **strongly Protestant** — over half of the group identifies as Protestant when using the broad CURREL label.  
  - It also includes a sizable share of **Catholics**, making this a clearly **more traditionally religious** group.
  - Minority traditions are represented here as well, but in smaller numbers.

- Compared to RELTRAD, CURREL's broader categorization **masks important differences** within Protestantism.  
  - Where RELTRAD distinguished between Evangelical, Mainline, and Black Protestant subgroups, CURREL collapses them — which **exaggerates the religious vs. secular divide**.

- **Key Insight**: Using CURREL simplifies the religious landscape into a sharper contrast between **Protestant (Cluster 1)** and **Unaffiliated (Cluster 0)** —  
  but at the cost of losing the **ideological diversity within those large traditions** that RELTRAD reveals.


## `K = 5`
Now we will use `k=5` to capture more nuanced sociopoltiical differences and possible capture differences between the two subgroups.

```{python}
kmeans_5 = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
df_clean["cluster_5"] = kmeans_5.fit_predict(X_scaled)

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
df_clean["pca1"] = X_pca[:, 0]
df_clean["pca2"] = X_pca[:, 1]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df_clean, x="pca1", y="pca2", hue="cluster_5", palette="Set2")
plt.title("KMeans Clustering with k=5 (PCA-reduced)")
plt.legend(title="Cluster")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```{python}
pd.crosstab(df_clean['cluster'], df_clean['CURREL'])
```

**Cluster profiles by feature (Standardized Average)**
```{python}
cluster_profiles_5 = df_clean.groupby('cluster_5')[features].mean().T
cluster_profiles_5.columns = [f'Cluster {i}' for i in cluster_profiles_5.columns]
cluster_profiles_5.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(16, 6), colormap='Set2')
plt.title("Cluster Feature Averages (k=5)")
plt.ylabel("Mean value (standardized scale)")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

**Cluster 0 (Green-teal)**  
This group tends to be slightly more moderate or mixed overall.  

- Moderate scores on most sociopolitical and religious indicators  
- Average levels of belief, practice, and spirituality  
- Somewhat lower education and income  
- Less ideologically extreme compared to others

*This cluster may represent a blend of individuals with mixed traditional and secular tendencies, possibly more centrist or disengaged.*

**Cluster 1 (Blue)**  
This is the most consistently progressive cluster.  

- High support for LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and diversity  
- Strong belief in evolution and scientific reasoning (`GUIDE_B`, `GUIDE_D`)  
- Politically liberal, Democratic-leaning  
- High education and income  
- Low religiosity and traditional markers

*This group appears to be secular, highly educated, and socially liberal — likely young professionals or cultural progressives.*

**Cluster 2 (Light Green)**  
The most religiously devout and traditional group.

- Very high scores on religious beliefs (`GOD`, `HLL`, `SOUL`, `PRAY`) and practice  
- High religiosity indicators (`MEMB`, `ATTNDONRLS`, `CHATTEND`)  
- Lower political liberalism  
- Lower belief in science-based reasoning  
- Strong traditional values around family and gender roles

*This is a classically religious conservative group with strong spiritual commitments and more traditional moral views.*

**Cluster 3 (Pink)**  
Civic-oriented and socially engaged cluster.  

- High political participation (`IDEO`, `PARTY`), social concern, and group involvement  
- Strong on science indicators and pro-social values  
- Moderate to high religiosity, but more practice than strict belief  
- High openness and diversity acceptance

*This group is civically involved and socially inclusive — possibly religious moderates who are socially progressive.*

**Cluster 4 (Purple-gray)**  
A spiritually-inclined but skeptical or questioning cluster.  

- Lower institutional religiosity, but moderate levels of spiritual activity (`SPIRACT`, `SPIRPER`)  
- High scores on existential openness (e.g., `SOUL`, `GRACE`)  
- Less trust in organized religion  
- More individualistic or exploratory in values

*This may reflect the “spiritual but not religious” demographic — interested in meaning and morality but detached from institutions.*


***RELTRAD Distribution per Cluster**
```{python}
# Optional: drop "refused" or unclear categories
excluded = ["Don't know/refused", "Other Christian", "Other World Religions", "Other Faiths"]
df_clean = df_clean[~df_clean['RELTRAD_label'].isin(excluded)]

# RELTRAD by cluster
ct_5 = pd.crosstab(df_clean['cluster_5'], df_clean['RELTRAD_label'], normalize='index')
ct_5.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(14, 7), colormap='tab20')
plt.title("RELTRAD Distribution by Cluster (k=5)")
plt.xlabel("Cluster")
plt.ylabel("Proportion")
plt.legend(title="Religious Tradition", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

#### Conclusions 

- **Cluster 0**: Predominantly made up of **Historically Black Protestants**, with secondary representation from **Evangelical Protestants** and **Catholics**.  
  - This cluster likely represents a **traditionally religious group**, potentially with strong communal or institutional religious ties.
  - Despite the Evangelical share, it is not dominated by unaffiliated individuals like some other clusters.

- **Cluster 1**: **Heavily Evangelical Protestant**.  
  - The proportion of Evangelicals is the largest of any cluster, with smaller shares from other traditions.
  - This likely reflects a **socially conservative**, **religiously committed** group, in line with Evangelical affiliation.

- **Cluster 2**: Overwhelmingly **Religiously Unaffiliated**.  
  - This cluster has the **highest concentration of unaffiliated individuals**, with minimal representation from traditional religious groups.
  - It strongly suggests a **secular or spiritually independent profile**, potentially linked to non-institutional values and ideologies.

- **Cluster 3**: Diverse mix — large shares of **Catholics**, **Mainline Protestants**, and **Evangelicals**.  
  - This balanced representation points to **moderate religiosity** or **pluralistic orientation**.
  - It may reflect those who identify with a religion but are less ideologically extreme or institutionally embedded.

- **Cluster 4**: High representation of the **Religiously Unaffiliated**, but with meaningful portions of **Mainline Protestants** and **Catholics**.  
  - This blend implies a **semi-secular group** that may combine religious identity with more progressive or individualized belief systems.

**Summary Insight**:
- Clusters **1 and 0** lean most strongly toward **institutional religiosity**, especially with Evangelical and Historically Black Protestant affiliations.
- **Cluster 2** is the most clearly **secular**, dominated by the unaffiliated.
- **Clusters 3 and 4** fall in the middle, combining **moderate religious identity** with **some degree of secularization or pluralism**.

This distribution further reinforces the idea that **religious identity and worldview are not one-to-one** — even highly religious groups like Evangelicals appear across clusters, but their dominant presence in one cluster signals **ideological clustering within religion itself**.


***CURREL Distribution per Cluster**

```{python}
kmeans_5 = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
df_clean['cluster_5'] = kmeans_5.fit_predict(X_scaled)
df_clean_currel = df_clean[~df_clean['CURREL_label'].isin(excluded_currel)]


ct_currel_5 = pd.crosstab(df_clean_currel['cluster_5'], df_clean_currel['CURREL_label'], normalize='index')

# Plot the stacked bar chart
ct_currel_5.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(14, 7), colormap='tab20')
plt.title("CURREL Distribution by Cluster (k=5)")
plt.xlabel("Cluster")
plt.ylabel("Proportion")
plt.legend(title="Current Religion", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Conclusions

- **Cluster 2** is by far the most **secular cluster**, with the **Religiously Unaffiliated** making up nearly the entire group.
  - This aligns with the RELTRAD distribution for this cluster, confirming a consistently non-religious identity.

- **Clusters 0 and 3** show a **strong Protestant majority**, which is much more pronounced under CURREL than in RELTRAD.
  - This reflects how collapsing Protestant subgroups (Evangelical, Mainline, Black Protestant) into a single label **masks important ideological variation** seen in RELTRAD.
  - These clusters also contain a modest share of Catholics and religious minorities.

- **Cluster 1**, while also Protestant-heavy, includes a notable presence of **Mormon**, **Muslim**, and **Catholic** identifiers — giving it a more **institutionally religious and theologically diverse** makeup than others.

- **Cluster 4** reflects a more mixed composition, with moderate shares of both **Protestants and the Unaffiliated**, plus some **Jewish** and **Catholic** identifiers — suggesting a **less clearly polarized** religious identity.


**Key Insight**:
- **RELTRAD** and **CURREL** tell subtly different stories.  
  - CURREL simplifies religious identity into broad categories, exaggerating the Protestant/Unaffiliated split.  
  - RELTRAD captures **within-group diversity** — showing that, for example, not all Protestants cluster the same way.

So while “religion” as a single label might feel like a strong predictor, it’s really the **granularity of religious identification** that matters in understanding sociopolitical alignment.

### Conclusion

**Political Cluster Interpretation (k=4)**

- **Cluster 0**: Politically moderate-progressive. Mid-to-high on government support for the poor and more liberal (`IDEO`, `PARTY`), but slightly lower on trust in large government (`GOVSIZE1`).

- **Cluster 1**: More conservative. Scores lower on liberal ideology, party identification, and assistance programs. Tends toward traditionalist values.

- **Cluster 2**: Highly liberal-progressive cluster. Very high scores on political ideology (`IDEO`) and party affiliation, strong support for government aid.

- **Cluster 3**: Politically disengaged or centrist. Lowest scores across the board — could reflect apolitical or ideologically neutral individuals.

**RELTRAD & CURREL Distributions:**

- Cluster 2 (liberal) has the largest share of **religiously unaffiliated**.
- Cluster 1 (conservative) is **dominated by Evangelical Protestants**.
- Cluster 0 and 3 are more mixed, with **Mainline Protestants and Catholics** appearing across both.
- CURREL confirms this: Protestants are concentrated in Cluster 1, while Cluster 2 shows more unaffiliated.

**Key Insight**: Political identity is tightly tied to religious affiliation in this dataset — Evangelicals cluster together conservatively, while the unaffiliated and Mainline Protestants show more liberal leanings.

### Conclusions

**Religious Practice Clustering (k=2)**

- **Cluster 0** represents individuals with high levels of religious practice.
  - These respondents report frequent attendance at religious services (`ATTNDPERRLS`, `ATTNDONRLS`) and higher frequency of prayer (`PRAY`).
  - They also report higher membership in religious organizations (`MEMB`) and greater participation in religious rituals or expressions (`PRAC_A`, `PRAC_B`, `GRACE`).

- **Cluster 1** consists of individuals with generally lower levels of formal religious participation and practice.
  - Scores across all variables are consistently lower, suggesting less institutional involvement and personal religious activity.

**RELTRAD** distribution:
- Cluster 0 includes a large share of the **Religiously Unaffiliated**, along with Catholics and Mainline Protestants.
- Cluster 1 is strongly dominated by **Evangelical Protestants**, with additional presence from Historically Black Protestants and Catholics.
- The divide aligns closely with levels of religious participation — more frequent participation tracks with Evangelical identity.

**CURREL** distribution:
- Cluster 0 is more secular overall — **Religiously Unaffiliated** make up the largest single group.
- Cluster 1 is overwhelmingly **Protestant**, suggesting that current affiliation with a religious tradition correlates strongly with higher levels of religious engagement.

These clusters show a clear division between **institutionally religious individuals** (Cluster 1) and **those who are less religiously active or unaffiliated** (Cluster 0).

### Conclusions

**Cluster 0**  
- Demonstrates **high engagement** in spiritual activities:  
  - Frequent prayer (`PRAY`), grace before meals (`GRACE`), and both formal and informal religious practice (`PRAC_A`, `PRAC_B`)  
  - Strong spiritual experiences and activities (`EXP_D`, `EXP_G`, `SPIRACT_C`, `SPIRACT_F`)  
  - Elevated retreat attendance (`RTRT`)  
- **Surprisingly**, this spiritually active group is **dominated by the religiously unaffiliated** — especially in both `RELTRAD` and `CURREL`.
  - That is, many in this cluster do not identify with a formal religion, but still engage deeply in spiritual behavior.

**Cluster 1**  
- Displays **lower but still present levels** of spiritual activity:  
  - Less ritual participation and fewer experiential indicators  
- Compositionally, this cluster is made up of **more traditionally affiliated individuals** — especially **Evangelical Protestants** and **Catholics**, as shown in both religion variables.

This clustering flips common assumptions: **the most spiritually active group is not the most traditionally affiliated**. In fact, **those who identify as religiously unaffiliated dominate the high-engagement cluster** — similar to what was observed in **religious practice clustering**, where Cluster 0 also showed **both high practice levels and high unaffiliated rates**.

Behavioral measures of spirituality (like prayer or retreat attendance) are not tightly bound to religious labels. Many "unaffiliated" individuals are **deeply engaged** in practice, while some traditionally affiliated groups show more nominal participation.  

This **mirrors the pattern** seen in **religious practice clustering**, reinforcing the idea that **spiritual action and religious identity are increasingly decoupled** in contemporary contexts.

### Conclusion 
### Demographic Clusters

**Cluster 0** consists of individuals who are generally **younger**, more racially and ethnically diverse (`RACECMB`, `AFROHISP`), and more mobile (`MOVED`). They are slightly more likely to be unmarried and less rooted in their current community.

**Cluster 1**, in contrast, is **older**, more likely to be white, and more often married. They also report more geographic stability and higher likelihood of U.S. nativity (`USGEN`), indicating a more settled and possibly traditional demographic profile.

From a religious identity perspective:

- **Cluster 0** includes a broad religious mix with higher representation of the **religiously unaffiliated**, along with notable shares of **Mainline Protestants** and **Evangelicals**.
- **Cluster 1** leans slightly more **Catholic** and **Evangelical**, with lower unaffiliated representation compared to Cluster 0.

In terms of **CURREL**, this same trend is visible: Cluster 0 leans more secular, while Cluster 1 shows greater **Protestant and Catholic affiliation**.

While these demographic clusters reflect meaningful variation in age, race, and stability, the **religious differences between them are not as stark** as those seen in clusters based on religious practice or values. This suggests that **demographics alone don't strongly segment religious worldview**, but they may help shape predispositions.

### Conclusion

### Science & Worldview Clustering (k=2)

Cluster differences on science and metaphysical worldview are present but **less stark** than in domains like religious practice.

- **Cluster 0** shows **greater belief in evolution** and scientific reasoning (e.g., higher means on `EVOL`, `GUIDE_B`, `GUIDE_D`). 
  - However, their scores on items like `RELIDISP` (religious distrust of science) are relatively neutral, not fully secular.
  - Compositionally, this cluster includes **more religiously affiliated individuals**, particularly **Evangelical Protestants** and **Catholics**.

- **Cluster 1**, in contrast, expresses **stronger spiritual openness** and **lower traditional religiosity**.
  - High scores on `GTHGHT` (sense of purpose) and `SCPRY2` (spiritual practices), combined with lower evolution endorsement, suggest a more **spiritual-but-not-scientific** orientation.
  - Religiously, this cluster is **dominated by the Unaffiliated**, though there's also a presence of Mainline Protestants and religious minorities.

- Across both RELTRAD and CURREL:
  - **Cluster 1 has a much larger share of the Religiously Unaffiliated**, while
  - **Cluster 0 includes more Protestants and Catholics**.

These clusters suggest that **worldview-based divisions are real but less polarized** than in direct measures of belief or religious practice. The relationship between science, purpose, and belief appears more complex — possibly shaped by culture, identity, and education as much as formal religion.
